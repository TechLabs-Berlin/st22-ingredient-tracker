Ingreduce is a website that provides recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have at hand. Our focus is reducing food waste; we are different from traditional websites with our intelligent ingredient-based search. 
After creating your user profile, you can keep track of the ingredients you have at home by searching for and adding them to your inventory and then select must-have ingredients that you want to use. According to your selection, you will receive recipe recommendations. 
Ingreduce is a project part of the TechLabs Berlin 2022 Summer Term, created by TechLabs students from the User Experience, Web Development, and Data Science tracks.
