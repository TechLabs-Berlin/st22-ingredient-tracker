The results were incredible. Serve with an arugula salad.","prep":"20 mins","cook":"30 mins","additional":null,"total":"50 mins","servings":"2","yield":"2 servings","ingredients":"2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves; kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste; 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste; \u00bd cup all-purpose flour, or as needed; 1 large egg, beaten; 1\u2009\u00bd cups panko bread crumbs, divided, or more as needed; 1 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated (Optional); \u00bc cup olive oil for frying; 3 tablespoons unsalted butter; 8 ounces brown mushrooms, sliced; salt to taste; 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour; \u00bd cup dry Marsala wine; 2 teaspoons lemon juice; 2 cups chicken broth; 1 pinch ground black pepper; 1 pinch cayenne pepper; 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley","instructions":"Place chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap, or a cut-open zip-top bag, and use a meat pounder to flatten the meat to about 1\/4-inch thickness. Season chicken on both sides of the chicken with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and transfer to a large plate. Sift flour over both sides of the chicken until the surface is completely coated. Transfer to a clean plate. Brush away any excess flour from the plate. Sprinkle about 1\/4 inch of panko onto the surface of the plate. Pour the egg over the floured chicken and use a brush to paint evenly over the meat. Flip and repeat on the other side. Once chicken has been thoroughly coated with the egg, pick up each piece with tongs, letting the excess egg drip off, and place on the plate of panko. Generously sprinkle panko over the top of the chicken and press in with your hands or tongs. Flip the chicken over, and sprinkle more panko over the top. Repeat until the chicken is well breaded all over. Sprinkle a light coating of the Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top of the chicken and press lightly into the breading with your hands. Flip and repeat on the other side. Transfer to a plate sprinkled with more panko. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator until you're ready to pan-fry. To make the sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over high heat; add the mushrooms and a large pinch of salt. Cook mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in flour. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 2 minutes. Pour in Marsala and lemon juice and use a spatula or spoon to scrape any caramelization from the bottom of the pan. Pour in chicken broth and raise heat to medium-high. Season with black pepper and cayenne and bring to a simmer. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it reduces and thickens slightly. Keep hot until needed or let cool and reheat when needed. Before serving, some freshly chopped parsley can be stirred in. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the breaded chicken to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Serve immediately with Marsala sauce underneath or spooned over the top.","nutrition":"953 calories; protein 61.6g; carbohydrates 101.2g; fat 34.4g; cholesterol 254.2mg; sodium 1911.4mg.","images_url":"https:\/\/imagesvc.meredithcorp.io\/v3\/mm\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F43%2F2021%2F11%2F04%2Fimage-41.jpg; https:\/\/imagesvc.meredithcorp.io\/v3\/mm\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-assets.meredithcorp.io%2Fbffb8ab9c3f7ac58cc97a4aaa8eb8700%2F1646953991IMG_0152.jpeg; https:\/\/imagesvc.meredithcorp.io\/v3\/mm\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F9422273.jpg; https:\/\/imagesvc.meredithcorp.io\/v3\/mm\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F9408602.jpg"},{"recipe_link":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/recipe\/236703\/chef-johns-chicken-kiev\/","name":"Chef John's Chicken Kiev Recipe","description":"Delicious chicken Kiev with homemade garlic and parsley butter.

Tightly wrap each chicken ball in plastic wrap; transfer to a plate and chill in the freezer until the gathered bottoms hold together and are slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Whisk flour and 2 teaspoons salt together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs together in another shallow bowl. Pour panko bread crumbs into third bowl. Remove chicken breast balls from plastic wrap. Gently press them into the flour mixture to coat; shake off any excess flour. Dip into beaten eggs, then press into bread crumbs.

Dip each skewer of pork into the egg mixture, then dip in crumbs; dip the skewers a second time into egg mixture and then crumbs. Gently lay the skewers, a few at a time, into the hot oil, and brown until the coating is crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Set the fried skewers aside while you finish the rest. Once the skewers are all browned, set them on the wire rack in the baking dish. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. Carefully place the baking dish with the skewers into the preheated oven, and bake until hot and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake 10 minutes more to dry out the crumb coating.

Pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions. (I like to soak up to an hour or two - whatever you have time for.) This step is SO important in taking the bitter taste of the liver out. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Separate onion rings, and saute them in butter until soft. Remove onions, and melt remaining butter in the skillet. Season the flour with salt and pepper, and put it in a shallow dish or on a plate. Drain milk from liver, and coat slices in the flour mixture. When the butter has melted, turn the heat up to medium-high, and place the coated liver slices in the pan. Cook until nice and brown on the bottom. Turn, and cook on the other side until browned. Add onions, and reduce heat to medium. Cook a bit longer to taste. Our family prefers the liver to just barely retain a pinkness on the inside when you cut to check.

Place over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, until very thick and just about to bubble. If you want to check, it should be at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Pull off the heat and transfer into a measuring cup; you will need exactly 1\/2 cup. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Prepare dough: Combine bread flour, cooled starter, salt, sugar, yeast, warm milk, and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Beat on low speed until dough begins to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl, scraping down the sides as needed, about 5 minutes.

Press on dough a bit to be sure it's evenly distributed. Cover the pan and let dough rise until it comes to just about the top of the pan, 35 to 45 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with just enough milk to lightly coat the surface. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the loaf is beautifully puffed up, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for 10 minutes.

Poke and prod the dough with a silicone spatula; if large amounts of dough stick to the spatula, add a little more flour.

Drape a piece of plastic wrap over the baking sheet (do not seal tightly). Let buns rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat remaining egg with milk in a small bowl, using a fork, until mixture is thoroughly combined. Very gently and lightly brush tops of buns with egg wash without deflating the risen dough.
